# Food Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project combines **Deep Learning** with **market insights** to build an AI-powered food recognition system. It explores how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can automatically classify food images and lays the foundation for applications such as **ingredient recognition, nutritional transparency, and cultural awareness** in Dutch cuisine.

## Business Value  

Based on market research (see `[Business-Understanding-Market-Research.pdf](https://github.com/zpilitowska1/food-recognition-cnn/blob/main/Business-Understanding-Market-Research.pdf)`):  

- **Problem**: Current apps lack accurate recognition of Dutch dishes, ingredient transparency, and personalized dietary recommendations.  
- **Stakeholders**: Consumers, tourists, dietitians, and fitness enthusiasts demand **fast, accurate, and affordable** recognition tools.  
- **Opportunities**:  
  - First-mover advantage in **Dutch cuisine recognition**  
  - Integration with diet/nutrition apps for personalized meal tracking  
  - Partnerships with restaurants, nutritionists, and research institutions

## Future Work

- Expand dataset to cover more Dutch and international foods.
- Experiment with transfer learning (ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet).
- Deploy as a mobile/web app for real-time food recognition.
- Integrate nutritional analysis and personalized diet tracking.
